# SMS Classifier
This is a small K-Nearest Neighbour classifier built using Principal Component Analysis to predict if a given SMS message is going to be spam (i.e., undesired) or ham (i.e., desired)!

This is accomplished via two separate Jupyter notebooks: one where the model is generated (including some background justifying the choices) and saved, and another where the model is loaded and actually used!

All the required packages should be available to use via the `venv` virtual enviroment that was created.
